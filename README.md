# Ladder and Snake Game

## Overview
This program is an implementation of the classic Ladder and Snake game for 2 to 4 players. Players take turns rolling a dice, moving through the game board, encountering ladders and snakes, and the first player to reach the 100th square wins.

## How to Play
1. Run the `PlayLadderAndSnake` class to start the game.
2. Follow the prompts to input the number of players (between 2 and 4).
3. Enter names for each player with exactly 5 characters.
4. The program will randomly determine the order in which players will start based on the dice values.
5. Players take turns rolling the dice, moving through the board, and following the rules of ladders and snakes.
6. The game continues until one player reaches the 100th square.

## Important Notes
- Ensure that you have Java installed to run the program.
- The game logic is partially implemented. You may need to complete the `LadderAndSnake` class with additional game-specific methods.
- The sorting logic for three players is incomplete; you may need to implement this based on a similar approach used for two players
